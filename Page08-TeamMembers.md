From left to right: 

**Dai Tran** is the team lead of the SLAM Air Quality Monitoring Robot team. Her primary
responsibility is in scheduling, organizing, and leading team and team-advisor meetings. She
develops the content for the written and presentation aspects of the project. She handles team
conflicts and concerns. She focuses on hardware testing and verification of electrical
connections of components. She also supports the team in research.

**Erick Campos** is primarily in charge of the software design of the robot and web interface. Paul worked on
an autonomous robot in the past, and thus has experience with the types of problems involved in
robotics. He has significant software experience in the languages used in the project, including
web interface design. He also has some knowledge working with CAD tools to design both
circuit boards and mechanical parts.

**Kyle Cubba** has extremely relevant lab experience in a cleanroom facility at ASU’s CSSER cleanroom.
He was responsible for conducting market research through interviews (some on-site) and
collecting product feedback from industry. He also helps handle many of the hardware aspects of
the project, including the wiring and electrical soldering of the SLAMbot’s underlying circuitry,
designing the physical occupation grid, and designing and 3D-printing the looks-like prototype.

**Jerry Li** is primarily focusing on the software designs of the robot, his role includes: writing code for
the robot to perform various functions, researching, and debugging code errors. His knowledge
in programming will be used to configure and port components to the BBB. He will manipulate
data from both the IMU and LIDAR to assist in the code which in turn will be used in
determining the location of the robot. Whereas, his researching and debugging skills are used for
troubleshooting obstacles that show up upon coding.
